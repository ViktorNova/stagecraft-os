stagecraft-os
=============

Real-time pro-audio appliance OS for modern electronic musicians and multimedia performances built on Linux, with a user interface designed to "boot and play" like pro-audio hardware does (this is not a 'desktop OS').

Features such as network MIDI, OSC routing & OSC <=> MIDI translation, DMX lighting control, pattern based groove sequencer, drum sampler, and high-quality softsynths/effects, are all pre-configured and ready to go out of the box (among many others)
